DKO WP Snippets
===============

Useful WordPress snippets I've collected from various sources and used on
several sites.

There are probably plugins that do all the same things.

Add as a submodule or just download and add to your theme. E.g. if you
cloned/copied into ```lib/snippets/``` in your theme, add this to your
``` functions.php ```:

``` require_once get_template_directory() . '/lib/snippets/update-nag.php'; ```
